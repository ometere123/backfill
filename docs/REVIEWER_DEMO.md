# Reviewer demo path

## Evidence categories

1. **Required lifecycle evidence** — connect on Studionet, create/open an epoch, fund the pool, submit a claim, evaluate it, and show canonical reads and finalized parent receipts.
2. **Controlled `INCONCLUSIVE` evidence** — a bounded model/source failure may end as canonical `INCONCLUSIVE` with zero weight and no payout. Epoch 7 is the live example; its forensic receipt is documented in [DEPLOYMENT_EVIDENCE.md](DEPLOYMENT_EVIDENCE.md).
3. **Optional positive-payout evidence** — only a claim that is canonically `ELIGIBLE` with positive weight may proceed through challenge, epoch finalization, pool finalization, and payout. This branch is not currently live-proven.
4. **Native transfer evidence** — a payout/refund claim requires the parent transaction plus the correlated triggered child transaction, exact recipient, exact native value, child finality, and child execution result. The zero-weight refund child is live-proven; a payout child is not.

## Reviewer path

1. Connect a wallet and switch it to Studionet.
2. Open an epoch and fund its pool with exactly 1 GEN.
3. Submit a real, pre-existing public contribution URL.
4. Evaluate the claim and show the authoritative outcome. A successful eligible decision must show grounded evidence and positive weight; a bounded model/source failure must show `INCONCLUSIVE`, zero weight and a retry state.
5. Open the bounded challenge route only when canonical state and deadlines permit it.
6. Finalize the epoch after every claim is terminal, then finalize the pool.
7. For a positive-weight claim, claim GEN and show the parent receipt plus the correlated triggered child transfer. The current fresh deployment evidence intentionally proves the zero-claim refund branch; positive-weight payout remains an unexercised branch and must not be inferred from the refund evidence.
8. For a zero-weight epoch, refund the funder's credit and show the parent receipt plus the correlated triggered child transfer. This path is live-proven in [DEPLOYMENT_EVIDENCE.md](DEPLOYMENT_EVIDENCE.md).

Live contract addresses and transaction IDs must be filled only from actual Studionet receipts. Do not present local mocks or an `INCONCLUSIVE` claim as payout evidence.
